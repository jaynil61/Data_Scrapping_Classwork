# Data_Scrapping_Classwork

In this project, Website data is scrapped using BeautifulSoup library in Python.
<br>
website : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States
<br>
This page contains the list of states in the U.S, population, and other details. We will try to get the names of the states and the population columns of the table.
The data is shown in multiple tables.

<br>
As shown in ipynb file, the two colums of the first table are fetched which are state-name and population of that respective state.
<br> 
Finally, the pandas dataframe is converted into csv file named 'state_population.csv.
